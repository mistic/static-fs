## Thanks

- @zeit for `pkg` as it was the first project we 
  start investigate in order to solve that problem and was also source of some ideas.
- @fearthecowboy for `static-link` as 
  it was the main inspiration for that project (it's codebase was used as the starting point for the current project).
- @electron for `asar`. While we found it in a later stage 
  of that project it was curious to understand how both projects share some of the same ideas,
  however still capable of achieving different results and different implementations.
